Incredibly secure, fast and light WebDav Server, built from Alpine image - bare minimum with no bells and whistles.
The image is only around 5.3 MB in size and the container takes around 10 MB of memory.

> This is a fork of https://github.com/maltokyo/docker-nginx-webdav with the following changes:
> * reducing the image layers and size (

> * filesystem secrets are never put in an environment variable,
> * complete runs as user, not root (for security),
> * listens to port tcp `8080`, not port tcp `80`
> * replacing the base Debian image with Alpine Linux,
> * improving the entrypoint script,
> * adding Github Actions build / push with automatic daily image building.

## Docker tags

Different tags mean different versions.
All tags on Dockerhub have passed the internal tests.
Usually you want to go with the `nightly` version to get the newest
Alpine Linux base. 

Overview of tag dates:

| Tag   |      Date      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| nightly | ![Dockerhub Nightly Push](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.docker.com%2Fv2%2Fnamespaces%2Fsfuhrm%2Frepositories%2Fdocker-nginx-webdav%2Ftags%2Fnightly&query=%24.tag_last_pushed&prefix=on%20&logo=docker&label=dockerhub%20nightly%20push&cacheSeconds=600) |
| master | ![Dockerhub Master Push](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.docker.com%2Fv2%2Fnamespaces%2Fsfuhrm%2Frepositories%2Fdocker-nginx-webdav%2Ftags%2Fmaster&query=%24.tag_last_pushed&prefix=on%20&logo=docker&label=dockerhub%20master%20push&cacheSeconds=600) |
| latest | ![Dockerhub Latest Push](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.docker.com%2Fv2%2Fnamespaces%2Fsfuhrm%2Frepositories%2Fdocker-nginx-webdav%2Ftags%2Flatest&query=%24.tag_last_pushed&prefix=on%20&logo=docker&label=dockerhub%20latest%20push&cacheSeconds=600) |

The meanings of the tags:

| Tag   |      Meaning      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| `nightly` | Nightly build of the master branch, usually up-to-date Alpine Linux verison. |
| `master` | Last master branch commit. Same features as `nightly`, but based on an older Appine Linux. |
| `latest` |  Latest release per Github tag, *not* necessarily the most up-to-date Alpine Linux version! |
| `v1.0.0` |  Version snapshot of the past. Used to go back to a previous well-known state. |

## How to use this image

The image listens to the container-side port `8080` as the container-side user `nginx` (host uid `100`, gid `101`).

```console
$ docker run --name keepass-webdav -p 80:8080 -v /path/to/your/keepass/files/:/media/data -d sfuhrm/docker-nginx-webdav
```

Or use the [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file included in this repository.

No built-in TLS support. Reverse proxy with TLS recommended.

## Volumes
- `/media/data` - served directory, needs to be accessible to the `nginx` user with uid `100` and gid `101`.

## Authentication

### With credentials in environment variables

To restrict access to only authorized users (recommended), you can define two environment variables: `$USERNAME` and `$PASSWORD`
```console
$ docker run --name webdav -p 80:8080 -v /path/to/your/shared/files/:/media/data -e USERNAME=webdav -e PASSWORD=webdav -d sfuhrm/docker-nginx-webdav
```

### With credentials in files

If you want to pass username and password in files like Docker secrets, you can define two environment variables: `$USERNAME_FILE` and `$PASSWORD_FILE`

## Docker compose

Or use docker-compose example with secret
```nano
version: "3.9"
name: webdav
secrets:
  USERNAME_SC:
    file: <path-to-your-secret>/username.secret.txt
  PASSWORD_SC:
    file:  <path-to-your-secret>/password.secret.txt
services:
  docker-nginx-webdav:
    #image: sfuhrm/docker-nginx-webdav
    build: .
    container_name: webdav
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    volumes:
      - "<path-you-want-to-share>:/media/data"
    secrets:
      - USERNAME_SC
      - PASSWORD_SC
    environment:
      - USERNAME_FILE=/run/secrets/USERNAME_SC
      - PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/PASSWORD_SC

```
